# My Website

My own person website. It contains habit tracker and blogs.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

First, build the app by running `npm run build`.

Then, run `npm run deploy` to deploy the app to GitHub Pages.

## Tools

Here are a list of tools that I used to built this webpage: 

- [SvelteKit-Github-Pages](https://metonym.github.io/sveltekit-gh-pages/)
- [Cal-Heatmap](https://github.com/wa0x6e/cal-heatmap)
- [JSON-Rules-Engine](https://github.com/CacheControl/json-rules-engine)
- [JSON Rule Editor](https://www.json-rule-editor.com/#/home)

## Things to remember:

*For the JSON Rule, how do I set the priority of a rule?*

> You set the rules "closer" to the beginning of the array, that way when it's get evaluted you can use events[0].
